    <h1><strong>Some Projects I've Worked On:</strong></h1>
    <p>
        I've worked on a number of projects while attending DevCodeCamp
        utilizing C#. </p>

        <p>Some of them include:</p>

        <p><i>FizzBuzz:</i> A small program that counts from 1 to 100
        in which multiples of 3 are replaced with the word "Fizz,"
        multiples of 5 are replaced with "Buzz," and multiples of 
        both 3 and 5 are replaced with "FizzBuzz."</p>

        <p><i>Rock Paper Scissors Lizard Spock:</i> A slightly more complicated game of 
        Rock Paper Scissors, which allows for a player to compete with either another
        player or computer player.</p>

        <p><i>Robots Vs. Dinosaurs:</i> A game in which a fleet of 3 robots and 
        a herd of 3 dinosaurs battle resulting in the victory of one team.</p>

        <p><i>War Dice Game:</i> A game where the user can input a number of 
        sides for dice, then compare rolls to determine a winner.

    <h2><strong>New Project Updates:</strong></h2>
    <p>As I continue in the DevCodeCamp course, I will be making many
        more projects. They'll be found on my github!
