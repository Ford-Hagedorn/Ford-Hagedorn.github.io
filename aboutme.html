    <h2><strong>Skills:</strong></h2>
    <p>
        I'm interested in learning languages, and can communicate effectively
        in English and Spanish, both speaking and correspondence,
        as well as having a growing ability to do so in French.</p>
        
        <p>Along with my abilities in language proficiency, I'm an effective
        communicator. I enunciate and have no issues with reiterating or
        rewording responses.</p>

        <p>I dedicate a lot of time to details so that way the things I produce
        are clear and organized. I always like to make sure that everyone who
        sees what I may be working on or have worked on see it
        in an easy-to-understand way. </p>

        <p>I'm an effective leader, often having team members working on the 
        aspects of a project in which they're most well-versed. I keep the team
        on task, with regular check-ins to ensure that my team is doing well
        and is utilizing their resources if they encounter issues. </p>

    
    <h3><strong>Fun Things:</strong></h3>
        <p>
        Some hobbies of mine include cooking, spending time with my friends,
        doodling and sketching, and playing video games.</p>

        <p>I'm left-handed!</p> 

        <p>My pronouns are He/Him/They/Them. </p>

        <p>I grew up in Northern California, near the Oregon border, but I 
        have lived in a number of different states.</p>

        <p>I was in the Air Force for 6 years as a linguist.</p>

        <p>I have two extra ribs! They're called cervical ribs and they're right
        under my collar bone. </p>
